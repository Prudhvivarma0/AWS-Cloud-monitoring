# Setup Instructions for AWS Monitoring and Alerting System

This file outlines the steps to set up monitoring and alerting for root API calls using AWS CloudTrail, SNS, and EventBridge.

---

## Step 1: Set Up CloudTrail

1. **Navigate to CloudTrail in the AWS Console**:
   - In the AWS Management Console, search for "CloudTrail" and open it.

2. **Create a New Trail**:
   - Go to the **Trails** section and click on **Create trail**.
   - **Trail Name**: Enter a name for your trail (e.g., `RootUserTrail`).

3. **Configure Trail Details**:
   - **Storage Location**: Select "Create new S3 bucket" and provide a unique name for the bucket (e.g., `my-cloudtrail-logs-uniqueid`).
   - **Log Events**: Ensure "Management events" is enabled with "Read/Write" set to "All".
   - **Apply trail to all regions**: Enable this option to ensure full coverage.

4. **Advanced Settings**:
   - Optional: Enable **Log file validation** if required.

5. **Create the Trail**:
   - Click **Create trail** and wait for it to set up.

## Step 2: Configure SNS for Email Notifications

1. **Navigate to SNS in the AWS Console**:
   - Search for "SNS" in the AWS Console and open it.

2. **Create an SNS Topic**:
   - Go to **Topics** and click on **Create topic**.
   - **Type**: Choose "Standard".
   - **Name**: Enter a name for the topic (e.g., `RootUserAlerts`).
   - Click **Create topic**.

3. **Subscribe to the Topic**:
   - Click on the topic you just created, then click **Create subscription**.
   - **Protocol**: Select "Email".
   - **Endpoint**: Enter your email address for receiving alerts.
   - Confirm the subscription by checking your email and clicking the confirmation link.

4. **Enable SNS Notifications in CloudTrail**:
   - Go back to **CloudTrail** and select your trail.
   - Click **Edit** in the "Trail settings" section.
   - Under SNS notifications, select your SNS topic (e.g., `RootUserAlerts`) and enable notifications.
   - Save the changes.

## Step 3: Set Up EventBridge Rule for Root User API Call

1. **Navigate to EventBridge in the AWS Console**:
   - Search for "EventBridge" and open it.

2. **Create a Rule**:
   - Go to **Rules** and click **Create rule**.
   - **Name**: Enter a name for the rule (e.g., `RootUserGetCallerIdentityAlert`).
   - **Event Bus**: Select "AWS default event bus".
   - **Rule Type**: Choose "Rule with an event pattern".

3. **Define the Event Pattern**:
   - Select **Custom patterns (JSON editor)** and paste in the contents of `eventbridge-root-user-api-call-rule.json` (see accompanying file).
   - This JSON code sets up the rule to monitor `GetCallerIdentity` API calls by the root user.

4. **Add SNS as the Target**:
   - Under **Target**, choose "AWS service" and select "SNS topic" as the target type.
   - Choose the SNS topic you created (e.g., `RootUserAlerts`).

5. **Configure Permissions (if prompted)**:
   - Allow EventBridge to create a role with permissions to publish to the SNS topic.

6. **Create the Rule**:
   - Review your settings and click **Create rule**.

## Step 4: Test the Setup Using AWS CLI

1. **Install and Configure the AWS CLI**:
   - If you havenâ€™t already, install the AWS CLI and configure it with your credentials:
     ```bash
     aws configure
     ```

2. **Test the Event with GetCallerIdentity Command**:
   - Open your terminal and run:
     ```bash
     aws sts get-caller-identity
     ```

3. **Check CloudTrail Logs and SNS Notification**:
   - Go to the **CloudTrail** console and check the **Event history** for the `GetCallerIdentity` event.
   - Verify that you received an email notification for the event.
